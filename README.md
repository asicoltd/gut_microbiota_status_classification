# 🧬 Gut Health Prediction and Analysis Using Structured Clinical Data

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for gut health prediction and personalized nutrition analysis using structured clinical and dietary data. The dataset captures a wide range of features related to medical history, dietary patterns, lifestyle factors, gastrointestinal health indicators, and microbiome-related elements.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following categories:

* **Anthropometrics**: Height, Weight, BMI
* **Medical History**: Diagnosed conditions, gastrointestinal issues, family history
* **Medications & Supplements**: Current and past use
* **Lifestyle & Diet**: Food intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep, stress
* **Gastrointestinal Indicators**: Bowel movements, abdominal symptoms, stool consistency
* **Nutrition**: Weekly intake of major food groups
* **Supplement Plan & Meal Plan**: Personalized intake, recommendations, reminders
* **Microbiota Status**: Gut health status, comparison with optimal values

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed the distribution of the target (e.g., gut health status or diagnosed condition)
* Visualized feature relationships (e.g., BMI vs diet composition)
* Detected outliers and missing data patterns
* Evaluated feature correlations and potential collinearity
* Identified class imbalance
* Used domain knowledge to determine feature relevance and importance

---

## 🧹 Step 2: Data Preprocessing

* **Missing Value Handling**: Imputation with domain-appropriate strategies
* **Categorical Encoding**: One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding based on feature context
* **Numerical Scaling**: Standardization and normalization
* **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE, Class Weights
* **Data Sanitization**: Cleaned invalid or inconsistent entries

---

## 🏗️ Step 3: Feature Engineering

* Flagged potential risk features using gut-health domain rules
* Mapped meal timing and supplement adherence to adherence scores

---

## 🤖 Step 4: Model Creation

**Baseline Models:**

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

**Advanced Models:**

* Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* LightGBM

**Transformer-Based Model:**

* TabTransformer (or equivalent tabular transformer architecture)

**Sequential Model:**

* LSTM enhanced with Transformer-style attention for time-dependent data (e.g., symptoms over time)

---

## 📊 Step 5: Model Evaluation

**Metrics Used:**

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* AUC-ROC for classification quality
* Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve Visualizations

**Model Comparison:**

* Performance of all models summarized in a tabular format for easy reference

---

## ⚙️ Step 6: Model Tuning


**Tuned Parameters:**

* Learning rate
* Max depth
* Regularization terms (L1, L2)
* Tree structure parameters (for boosting models)
* Neural network architecture tuning (for ANN, LSTM)

---

## 📌 Key Highlights

* Designed for **gut health prediction** and **personalized dietary guidance**
* Supports **clinical decision-making**, nutrition planning, and supplement intake monitoring
* Highly customizable with **tabular transformer models** and **deep learning**
* Can be extended for real-time applications and integrated into **digital health platforms**

---


## 📈 Future Improvements

* Incorporate time-series symptom logging for dynamic predictions
* Deploy as an interactive web app using Streamlit or Flask
* Integrate microbiota sequencing data (e.g., from 16S rRNA) if available
* Reinforcement learning for adaptive supplement plans
